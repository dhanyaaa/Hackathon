# Hackathon_Step by Step Wellness

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes based on medical records using machine learning techniques. The app will analyze the user's health data and predict whether they are likely to develop diabetes in the future or if they already have it. The model will leverage key medical features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. Users will receive real-time, actionable insights about their health, fostering early detection and personalized recommendations.

## Features
- Predicts diabetes risk using Logistic Regression.
- Provides **personalized health advice** based on glucose levels.
- Web-based **Flask API with JSON responses**.

## Model Training
We used **Logistic Regression** trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
The model was trained with **80% training, 20% testing** split.
