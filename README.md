# Hackathon


This project aims to develop a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes based on medical records using machine learning techniques. The app will analyze the user's health data and predict whether they are likely to develop diabetes in the future or if they already have it. The model will leverage key medical features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. Users will receive real-time, actionable insights about their health, fostering early detection and personalized recommendations.
